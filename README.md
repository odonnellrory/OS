My current waybar config was taken from https://github.com/XNM1/linux-nixos-hyprland-config-dotfiles as a base and I've been editing that to learn it.


It looks like this.

```
.
├── bin
├── hyprland
│   ├── hypr
│   └── waybar
└── nixos
    ├── desktop-environments
    └── display-managers


```

/bin is where I keep scripts.
/hyprland has the hyprland config, and a config to set my wallpaper.
/nixos has all of my nix configuration.  configuration.nix I have split into some separate files to tidy it up, the desktop environments and display managers have their own directories.
